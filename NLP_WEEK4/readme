NLP Asignment week 4 

Analysis Report

1. Text Preprocessing

The raw text data was cleaned and prepared for NLP analysis using:

Lowercasing – standardizing words (e.g., Hot → hot).

Tokenization – splitting documents into individual words.

Punctuation Removal – removing unnecessary symbols.

Stopword Removal – eliminating common words (e.g., is, the, I) that add little meaning.

The output is a list of tokenized, cleaned documents ready for analysis.


2. TF-IDF Analysis

Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) measures how important a word is to a document relative to the entire corpus.

Words frequent in one document but rare in others receive higher scores.

The top terms correctly reflected document content:

Weather-related docs: weather, hot, today

Racing-related docs: race, driver, track

This highlighted key differentiating terms in each document.


3. Word2Vec Embeddings

Word2Vec learns dense vector representations where similar words are close in the embedding space.

A small custom model was trained on the preprocessed corpus.

Similarity queries (e.g., weather, hot, race, horse) revealed meaningful relationships, though limited by dataset size.

A t-SNE visualization mapped embeddings into 2D, showing approximate word clusters.


4. Topic Modeling with LDA

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) uncovered four main topics:

Topic 1 – Racing: race, driver, car, sped, track, formula

Topic 2 – Weather: weather, hot, sunny, forecast, today, temperature

Topic 3 – Horse Racing: horses, spectators, cheered, finish, line, jockey

Topic 4 – Mixed / Event Coverage: event, crowd, fans, excitement, performance, season

Documents aligned well with these topics, confirming that LDA separated the corpus into four distinct themes.


Conclusion

The NLP pipeline successfully processed text data, extracted key terms with TF-IDF, generated semantic word relationships using Word2Vec,
and identified four coherent topics through LDA. These results demonstrate how preprocessing, feature extraction, embeddings,
and topic modeling can work together to uncover structure and insights within unstructured text.
